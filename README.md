This is a rust version of the original [The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler) written in Javascript. I came across a [Go version](https://github.com/hazbo/the-super-tiny-compiler) of the project which made me want to write one is rust too. It's a good way to practice some rust code. **This is currently WIP.**

## Usage
Run with cargo

```bash
$ cargo run
```

Yet to implement taking inputs from the command line. **TBA**

## Tests
```bash
$ cargo test
```
